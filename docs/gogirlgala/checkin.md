# 1. Check In

## Outline
This role is responsible for giving patrons the table number that they'll be seated at and a bidder number that corresponds to a bidder paddle at their seat.

This also gives us an opportunity to ask if the patron would like to register their credit card on file. 

## 'Home' State
For this role, you'll be best served by navigating to the Customer list and filtering by Go Girl Gala 2025

## A Patron Arrives
Once the patron has come to you and you've greeted them, we'll need to start with asking the Patron's name and entering it in to the search field.

Once you've found the patron, tap on their name and you'll see the table and bidder numbers that you can note on the patron's card and hand it to them. 

At this time, you'll offer the patron the opportunity to place their card on file.

## (Optional) Card on File
It's important to stress that placing the card on file is optional. It's to allow patrons a way to make transactions at the event without needing to reauthorize their card over and over. Entirely optional to do. If they prefer to swipe their card for later transactions, that is entirely feasable.

If the patron does elect to place their card on file, there is an interface further down on their Customer Profile that says 'Payment on File', you'll be able to press 'Add' to start the adding process. The fastest way is inserting the card in to the chip reader slot at the bottom of the Terminal. This will fill a credit card number in that only reveals the last four digits of the card number on the interface.

Many profiles will have email addresses filled ahead of time, but if not, the Terminal also requires an email address for receipts. It may be fastest to allow the patron to enter their email or ask that they provide the email.

Adding a card on file allows for easier checkout later in the event.
