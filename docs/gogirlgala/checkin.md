# 1. Check In

## Outline

As a check-in volunteer at the Go Girl Gala, you are the first face our guests
will see, so it’s important to create a warm and welcoming experience right from
the start. Please arrive on time, dressed professionally, and wearing your name
tag.

As each guest approaches your check-in station, greet them with a smile and say
something warm and genuine like, “Good evening! We’re so glad you’re here. Thank
you for supporting Girl Scouts tonight!”

Begin by asking for the guest’s name and locating their registration information
on the check-in list in the Square app. Once located, let them know their
assigned table number and bidder number, and explain that their bidder paddle,
with their number clearly marked, is waiting for them at their seat. This number
will be used throughout the evening for all bidding and donation purposes.

## Initial State

For this role, you'll be best served by navigating to the Customer list and
filtering by Go Girl Gala 2025

## A Patron Arrives

Once the patron has come to you and you've greeted them, ask for their name and
enter it into the search field on the Square app on your phone or terminal.

When you've found the patron, tap on their name. You’ll see their table and
bidder numbers, which you can write on their card before handing it to them.

  <a href="#checkin" class="close">×</a>
  <a href="#lightbox-patron-2" class="nav prev">‹</a>
  <a href="#lightbox-patron-2" class="nav next">›</a>
</div>

At this time, you'll also offer the patron the opportunity to place their card
on file.

## (Optional) Card on File

Kindly ask if they would like to register a credit card on file. You might say
something like:

“Would you like to put a card on file to make your evening easier? That way, you
won’t have to re-swipe for any auction items, champagne sales, or donations—it’s
just one less thing to think about. It’s completely optional, and you’re also
welcome to pay as you go if you prefer.”

If the guest agrees, take their card, swipe it using the Square reader, and
confirm that it’s been added to their profile. Thank them again and let them
know they’re all set.

Whether or not they choose to register a card, thank them sincerely for
attending. A friendly, “We’re so excited to have you here tonight. It’s going to
be a fantastic evening in support of Girl Scouts!” goes a long way.

If the patron chooses to place their card on file, scroll to the 'Payment on
File' section in their customer profile and press 'Add' to begin. The fastest
method is to insert the card into the chip reader at the bottom of the terminal.
This securely captures the card information and will only display the last four
digits.

Note: Many profiles will already have email addresses populated. If not, an
email will need to be added for receipt purposes. You can ask the patron to
enter their email directly or provide it aloud.
