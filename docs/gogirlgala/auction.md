# 3. Auction

## Outline
During the auction, volunteers will be stationed throughout the room to quickly collect winning bidder information and process payments. Speed and accuracy are crucial as we want to effectively capture the patron's commitment without error.

## Initial State
You'll be using the 'Checkout' interface, similar to regular sales. The Library will have all auction items listed with their details. Have this ready before the specific lot begins.

## When an Item Sells
As soon as the auctioneer announces "SOLD!", follow these steps:

1. Quickly locate the winning bidder
2. Confirm the final bid amount
3. If paying by card, open the auction item in the Library
4. Assign the patron to the transaction

## Processing Payment
Speed is important, but accuracy is crucial. Choose the appropriate payment method:

1. Card on File (Fastest Method):
   - If the patron registered their card during check-in, confirm and use this option
   - Confirm the amount and process immediately
   - The receipt will be automatically emailed

2. New Card Payment:
   - Take the patron's card
   - Tap or insert into the chip reader
   - Process the payment
   - Remove their card once approved

## Important Notes
- Position yourself strategically to quickly reach winning bidders
- Listen carefully to the auctioneer for the final bid amount
- If multiple items are being auctioned simultaneously, coordinate with other volunteers
- Always verify the bidder number matches the patron's name

## Complete
Once payment is processed:
1. Thank the patron
2. Confirm their email receipt is on the way
3. Return to your station for the next auction item
