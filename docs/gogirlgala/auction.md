# 3. Auction

## Outline
Once cocktail hour concludes, all check-in and sales volunteers will transition into the ballroom to assist with auction support and ongoing payment collection. You’ll be assigned to a specific quadrant of the room to ensure quick response times and consistent coverage.

Your primary responsibility is to process payments for:

Live auction items
Champagne sales
Live-ask donations

This phase moves fast, especially during the auction and live appeal—speed and accuracy are key. We want to ensure every generous gesture is captured efficiently.

Keep your snap bracelet and helium balloon on for visibility. Stay alert, mobile, and ready to assist when guests raise a paddle or flag down a volunteer.

When a winning bid is announced:

Approach the guest immediately
Confirm their bidder number and final bid amount
Ask: “Would you like to use the card you placed on file, or swipe a new one?”
Process the payment quickly and accurately

## Initial State
You'll be using the 'Checkout' interface, similar to regular sales. The Library will have all auction items listed with their details. Have this ready before the specific lot begins.

## When an Item Sells
As soon as the auctioneer announces "SOLD!", follow these steps:

Quickly locate the winning bidder
Confirm the final bid amount
If paying by card, open the auction item in the Library
Assign the patron to the transaction

## Processing Payment
Speed is important, but accuracy is crucial. Choose the appropriate payment method:

Card on File (Fastest Method):

If the patron registered their card during check-in, confirm and use this option
Confirm the amount and process immediately
The receipt will be automatically emailed

New Card Payment:

Take the patron's card
Tap or insert into the chip reader
Process the payment
Remove their card once approved

## Important Notes
Position yourself strategically to quickly reach winning bidders
Listen carefully to the auctioneer for the final bid amount
If multiple items are being auctioned simultaneously, coordinate with other volunteers
Always verify the bidder number matches the patron's name

## Complete
Once payment is processed:

Thank the patron
Confirm their email receipt is on the way
Return to your station for the next auction item

Throughout the evening, continue helping with champagne sales, additional auction items, and live appeal donations. Your presence helps maintain flow and keeps energy high.

Remember: a quick, “Thank you so much for supporting Girl Scouts tonight. We truly appreciate you!” makes a lasting impression.

If you encounter an issue or need backup, discreetly signal a staff member or fellow volunteer. Teamwork keeps us moving smoothly.

Stay upbeat. Stay flexible. Stay ready. Your role is fast-paced but fun, and your attentiveness helps ensure an amazing night for all!
