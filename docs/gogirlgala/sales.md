# 2. Sales

## Outline

As a sales volunteer, your role is to support a smooth and positive guest
experience by efficiently processing transactions throughout the evening. You
are an essential part of making our fundraising efforts successful, and your
friendliness, attention to detail, and availability will make a big impact!

During cocktail hour, your main focus will be assisting the Girl Scouts as they
work the room selling raffle tickets. The girls will engage the guests and
generate interest, your role is to step in to process payment.

Stay alert and move with the flow of the room. Make yourself visible and
approachable. Let the Girl Scouts know they can wave you down or bring guests to
you when someone is ready to pay.

When processing a payment, greet the guest with a smile and thank them for their
support. You might say, “Thank you so much for buying a raffle ticket! Good
luck!”

Then ask, “Would you like to use the card you registered at check-in, or would
you prefer to swipe a new one?” If the guest has a card on file, confirm the
purchase and process the charge. If not, swipe their card using your Square
reader and confirm the transaction.

## Initial State

Navigate to 'Checkout' in the app's main navigation. Under the Library, you’ll
see a list of available items to sell.

## Making a Sale

Start by selecting the item, reviewing the sale, and then asking the patron
their name so that you can assign them to the transaction. Once selected you'll
see a variety of payment options. One will state if their payment card is on
file. If it is, use that unless specified not to.

## Processing the Payment

Once you've entered the sale amount:

1. If using a new card:
   - Take the patron's card, tap or insert it in to the chip reader
   - The terminal will process the payment automatically
   - Once approved, remove their card

2. If using card on file:
   - The terminal will automatically generate and email a receipt if an email
     address is associated with the payment method.

## Complete

After the payment is processed successfully, thank the patron and hand them
their purchased items if applicable.
